// NOTES:
// Anonymous functions, also known as lambda functions, are functions without a name. 
// They provide a concise way to create functions on the fly. Here's the basic syntax in Dart:

(parameters) {
    // Function body
}

// Anonymous functions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions. For example:

var greet = (String name) {
    print('Hello, $name!');
};

greet('Alice'); // Outputs: Hello, Alice!

// They're particularly useful for short, one-time-use functions, such as in list operations:

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach((number) {
    print(number * 2);
});
// Anonymous functions make your code more readable and concise, especially when working with higher-order functions or callbacks.
