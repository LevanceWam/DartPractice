// Functions are essential building blocks in Dart programming. They are reusable pieces of code that perform specific tasks, making your programs more organized and efficient.

// In Dart, a function is a set of instructions grouped together to achieve a particular objective. Functions serve several important purposes:

// Code Reusability: Write once, use multiple times
// Modularity: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable parts
// Readability: Make code easier to understand and maintain
// Abstraction: Hide complex implementations behind simple interfaces
// Here's a simple example of a function in Dart:

void greet() {
    print('Hello, Dart!');
}

// Functions in Dart can take inputs (parameters), perform operations, and return results, making them versatile tools for structuring your code and solving problems efficiently.
