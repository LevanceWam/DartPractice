// NOTES:
/*
Assignment operators in Dart are used to assign values to variables. 
They provide a concise way to perform operations and assign the result in a single step. Let's explore the most common assignment operators:
*/

// Simple assignment (=)
int a = 5;

// Addition assignment (+=)
a += 3;  // Equivalent to: a = a + 3

// Subtraction assignment (-=)
a -= 2;  // Equivalent to: a = a - 2

// Multiplication assignment (*=)
a *= 4;  // Equivalent to: a = a * 4

// Division assignment (/=)
a /= 2;  // Equivalent to: a = a / 2
