// NOTES:
// Booleans in Dart are a simple yet powerful data type that represents true or false values. They are essential for making decisions in your code and controlling program flow.

// To declare a boolean variable in Dart, you use the bool keyword:

bool isRaining = true;
bool isSunny = false;
// You can also use type inference with the var keyword:

var isWeekend = true;
