// NOTES:
// Dart supports two main types of numbers: integers and doubles. Let's explore how to work with these numeric data types:
// 1. Integers (int): These are whole numbers without a decimal point.
int age = 43;
int score = 200;

// 2. Doubles (double): These are numbers with decimal points. 
double carPrice = 68.43;
double temp = 165.6;
