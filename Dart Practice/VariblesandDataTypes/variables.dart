/* In Dart, variables are containers that store data values. 
They act as named storage locations in your program's memory, 
 allowing you to work with and manipulate data efficiently. */

 /* 
 Variables are essential because they enable you to:

Store and retrieve information
Perform operations on data
Keep track of changing values in your program
In Dart, you can declare a variable using the var keyword. Here's a simple example: 
*/

var age = 39;

/* This line creates a variable named age and assigns it the value 25. Dart's type inference automatically determines that age is an integer based on the assigned value. */
